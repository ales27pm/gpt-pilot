# Agent Principles for 2025

GPT Pilot orchestrates work through a set of guiding principles that keep multi-agent interactions transparent and user aligned.

## 1. Agent (Space)
Maintain interruptible interfaces and modular agent swarms so users can pause, redirect, or swap agents without losing trust or context.

## 2. Agent (Time)
Agents log their reasoning and revisit prior states, enabling "explainable rewinds" and deep context for returning users.

## 3. Agent (Core)
Preserve explainability, minimal hallucination, and transparent decision logs. The core agent interprets intent and manages stable orchestration.

## 4. Agent (Adaptation)
- **Hyper-personalization via on-device ML**: Use edge libraries such as TensorFlow Lite for federated learning across sessions without central data silos. Capture device type, mood signals, and workflow history to tune agent nudges.
- **Proactive, predictive orchestration**: Replace passive notifications with anticipatory guidance. For example, a React dashboard (Framer Motion for fluid transitions) can reshape itself based on telemetry and semantic recall from a pgvector store.
- **Co-evolution with users**: Agents act as extensions of user intent and evolve alongside them.

## Responsible Reflection and Bias Mitigation
- **Ethics-aware prompts**: Augment agent prompts with guardrails trained on curated ethical datasets to detect fairness issues at each reasoning step.
- **Verifiable provenance**: Middleware (e.g., Python/FastAPI) can audit model outputs against user-defined ethics profiles and surface potential divergences in the UI.

These principles push agent systems from reactive tools toward intuitive collaborators while ensuring transparency, personalization, and ethical alignment.
