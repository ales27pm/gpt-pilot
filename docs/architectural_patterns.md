# Architectural Patterns for Real-Time, Edge-Resilient Interactions

Agent-centric systems increasingly operate in latency-sensitive environments where decisions must span cloud and edge contexts. Existing patterns such as **Sequential** pipelines and **Magentic** dynamic planning serve structured workflows, but real-time deployments demand additional considerations. The following patterns extend the catalog to address high-velocity, hybrid scenarios.

## Real-Time and Edge Patterns

### Synchronous Streaming
For collaborative, low-latency tasks, agents stream partial results to peers and UIs without waiting for full completion. This pattern supports live stock or ESG analysis where multiple agents run in parallel.

**Implementation path**
- Use Apache Kafka Streams or NATS for sub-millisecond messaging in Group Chat setups.
- Extend AutoGen's Magentic-One with WebRTC for instant UI updates.
- Provide a Node.js backend that streams partial results via Server-Sent Events, visualized with D3.js to render workflow graphs.
- Demo: parallel agents analyzing ESG data, generating live sentiment charts without full page reloads.

### Edge Handoff
Delegates low-latency work to device-local agents while maintaining continuity with cloud orchestrators. Enables seamless background-to-foreground transitions in mobile and web apps.

**Implementation path**
- Utilize Edge Handoff to move compute-intensive or latency-sensitive steps closer to devices.
- Coordinate background tasks through cloud agents and surface foreground interactions when context changes, e.g., user opens the app.
- Build orchestration using Kafka Streams or NATS for messaging and WebRTC channels for peer connections.

## Enhanced Visualization for Complex Flows
Dashboards for Sequential patterns scale poorly as agent counts rise. Adaptive interfaces prevent information overload in concurrent or streaming workflows.

**Implementation path**
- Integrate observability tools such as LangSmith to trace agent flows and measure latency.
- Develop a Vue.js component library: agents rendered as interactive Sankey diagrams using Vuex for state syncing and Cytoscape.js for dynamic graph layouts.
- Allow one-click drilling into handoffs, providing granular insight into streaming or edge transitions.

These additions future-proof GPT Pilot for real-time applications—from live ESG dashboards to autonomous SRE incident response—where delays could cascade into failure.
